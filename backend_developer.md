### What does a backend developer do?
* Writing server-side code
* Writing code to interact with a database
* Ensuring that the server-side code is secure and free of vulnerabilities
* Ensuring that the server-side code is optimised enough to handle large volumes of traffic

### Prerequisite Knowledge
Before you delve into frameworks, languages and technologies used by backend developers, there are certain things you should be comfortable with. (Google, articles and videos)
1. Understand what a server is and what the different kinds of servers are.
2. Learn about what a database is and the different kinds of databases out there.
3. Gain a fundamental understanding of what HTTP is. The communication between the server and the client (i.e. the “user” of the application — your web browser for example) happens by means of certain rules (a “protocol”) and you should have an understanding of how this protocol works.
4. Know what an Application Programming Interface (API) is. Understand the difference between REST APIs and SOAP APIs.

	* Basic DevOps

##### [Server](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/server.htm)
A server is a software or hardware device that accepts and responds to requests made over a network. The device that makes the request, and receives a response from the server, is called a client. On the Internet, the term "server" commonly refers to the computer system which receives a request for a web document, and sends the requested information to the client.

* Different types of servers
	* Application server
	* Blade server
	* Cloud server
	* Database server
	* Dedicated server
	* Domain name service
	* File server
	* Mail server
	* Print server
	* Proxy server
	* Standalone server
	* Web server

### Technologies and Languages
* The classic set of backend technologies (the “technology stack”) is called LAMP. It is an acronym that stands for Linux (operating system), Apache (server), MySQL (database), PHP (server-side language).
* Other choices:
	* Python + Django/Flask
	* JavaScript + NodeJS + MongoDB
	* Ruby
	* PHP
	* Java + Spring
	* Go
	* C#
* A few more thing:
	* Using database-as-a-service platforms (e.g. Mlab for MongoDB)
	* Using server-as-a-service platforms(e.g. Heroku, Digital Ocean, Amazon Web Services)

* Learn from others' code (GitHub)
* Learn to be a full stack engineer
* Consider learning frameworks like Ionic that let you build cross-platform apps using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. (e.g. MeteorJS)
